    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "\n",
    "** 1) Random Forest. In our dataset, after we tweak it so that we have only numerical variables, we ended up having 103 features. Using the Random Forest algorithm, we create several subsets of our data each with a subset of features to grow a tree and so we don't have to use all of the features, simplifying the process, plus besides classifing our data, this method gives as an estimation of variable importance, which can later on help us to narrow down our features and make our classification better and faster. This method handles well outliners and noise, can be run in paralellism, it does not tend to overfit the data by increasing the number of trees, and gives us helpful estimates such as variable importance and correlation. This is a very flexible method and can be used to most situations. A problem of this model is that as it grows many trees, each with it's own set of features and subset of data, looking at the trees independantely doesn't give you a lot of insight as it would to see a single decision tree, but you can still get useful informations of the data with the estimates described previously. Another problem is that as it doesn't have a lot of parameters and is relatively simple, other methods well tunned for especific situations usually leads to a better accuracy. A real-world application of this model is the Kinect of the Microsoft Xbox, it uses the random forest method to help identify the person and it's \"skeleton\", to understand it's movements. **\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2) Stochastic Gradiant Descent classifier. This classifier model is easy to implement and have a lot of opportunities for tuning so that it can be better tweaked to better adjust to your dataset. The major advantage of this model is its efficiency, it handles well large datasets so given the size of this dataset, SGD will make a good candidate to help CharityML with this task. A problem with this model is that it is sensitive to feature scaling so it is important to scale the features before using it. Another concern with this model is that it requires some hyperparameters such as the number of iterations. Real-World applications of this model includes image recognition problems and Natural Language Processing. **\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3) Logistic Regression. This is a easy to implement and easy to interpret model, that outputs a number between 1 and 0 that can be interpreted as a probability. It does not require too much computational resources and works better on datasets that are not too small so that it will not overfit the data. This model can also overfit if the dataset has multiple highly-correlated results. Another weakness is that Logistic Regression doesn't perform well with outliers and when it has misclassified instances in your training data. For this model, categorical data should be converted to real values and as this is a reasonable size dataset that has already used one-hot encod for the categorical data, this is a promissing candidate to this task. A real World application for life insurance actuaries that uses this model to predict, based on informations about the policy holder, sich as age, gender etc, the chances that this policy holder will die before the term of the policy expires. **"

    "**Answer: Analysing the task of identifying individuals that make more then 50,000 dollars, it was tested three models. For evaluating those models perfomances, it was calculated both the accuracy and the F-Score. Thinking about the problem, it is important that we take into consideration not just the percentage of correct results for that each model, but the false results (false positives and false negatives) too. As we are trying to identify possible donors, it is important that we consider as much candidates as we can and so we should avoid getting False Negative results because it would mean that we would disregard a possible donor whereas False Positives results would just mean that we would try to get donations of someone that doesn't make 50,000 dollars and so, as the data shows us, the person woudn't donate, but then even if someone makes more than 50,000 it still has the probability that he/she won't donate. **\n",
    "\n",
    "** Overall, as described above, we should take a closer look at the F-Score, giving more importance at the False Negatives results, so for that, I've chosen the F-Score using Beta = 2. With this is mind, looking at the results of the three models, we can see if we use 100% of the training test size, the model that had the best results for the F-Score at the testing set is the SGD (Stochastic Gradiant Descent). If we also look at the Accuracy Score, we see that the three models reach close results and even that the accuracy for the SGD is the lowest, it is not far behind, so I would still argue that it is the best choice. Finally, looking at the time spent to train the model and predict the results, the SGD was overall the fastest model, although the difference among them is not so relevant.**"

The Gradiant Descent technique measure (calculate) for each point in your data the error between the result that was suppose to have found (the real value) and the predicted result.

The problem of this approach is that, for large datasets, this requires too much time processing all those erros in each data point.** \n",

It does add however a feature that I didn't think of, the marital status.

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
